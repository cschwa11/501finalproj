# Which variables are associated with, and hence can be used to predict, the Rating of a movie on IMDB?
# Has the movie industry changed over time in terms of IMDB rating? As in, would the same movie preform the same 20 years ago as it does now?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

```{r}
load(url("http://people.math.binghamton.edu/qiao/data501/data/movies.RData"))

movies_alt=movies
df = subset(movies_alt, select = -c(imdb_num_votes , critics_rating, critics_score, audience_rating, audience_score, best_pic_nom, best_pic_win, top200_box, imdb_url, rt_url, actor1, actor2, actor3, actor4, actor5, director, title, studio))


set.seed(1234)
index = sample(c(rep(TRUE,450), rep(FALSE,201)))
SetA=df[index, ]
SetB=df[!index, ]

SetA

movies.lm.A= lm(imdb_rating~. ,data=SetA)
summary(movies.lm.A)

```

## 



```{r}
mse.ols = mean((SetB$imdb_rating - predict(movies.lm.A, SetB))^2)
(SetB$imdb_rating - predict(movies.lm.A, SetB))^2
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
